\section{Introduction}



\section{Results}
As can be observed in \ref{fig:BSS}, when the hedge adjustment frequency increases the portfolio is
fitted better to changes of the stock price, indicating a higher sensibility to market changes.
At the end, we can observe that both protfolio values show simimular resulr, but
whilst the daily adustemnt lead to a final portfolio value of 0, the weekly adjustemnt portfolio underperfoms leading
to negetive portfolio ($-1.3$).
This, we can conclude taht for same situation, a daily hedge adjustment can lead to lower intermideate stock price, but
it overperfomrs at maturiti the weekly adjustments.
